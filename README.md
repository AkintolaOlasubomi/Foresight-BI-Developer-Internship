## Background

Forggith Pharmaceuticals, a German pharmaceutical manufacturing company, relies on a network of distributors to bring their medicines to patients. Instead of selling directly to retailers or consumers, Forggith supplies its products to distributors, who then handle distribution to stores and pharmacies.
To track and optimize sales, Forggith provides distributors with a standardized report template. Distributors submit monthly sales data, which Forggith analyzes to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and ensure their marketing and sales strategies are achieving desired outcomes.
While Forggith doesn't engage directly with individual retailers, they do maintain contact through dedicated sales and marketing professionals. These experts work to ensure smooth product flow through the distributor network, ultimately reaching the shelves of retailers and ultimately, the hands of patients.

### Power BI Reporting Requirement.
